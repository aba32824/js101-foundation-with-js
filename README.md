# JS 101 - Foundation with JS

## Exercises: Small Problems

It's a list of small exercises to memorise/recall JS syntax. The list consists of the following tiny problems:

### Isn't it Odd?

Write a function that takes one integer argument, which may be positive, negative, or zero. This method returns true if the number's absolute value is odd. You may assume that the argument is a valid integer value.


### Odd Numbers
Log all odd numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, to the console, with each number on a separate line.

### Even Numbers
Log all even numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, to the console, with each number on a separate line.

### How big is the room?
Build a program that asks the user to enter the length and width of a room in meters, and then logs the area of the room to the console in both square meters and square feet.

**Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet**

### Sum or Product of Consecutive Integers
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then asks whether the user wants to determine the sum or the product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer, inclusive.

### Short Long Short
Write a function that takes two strings as arguments, determines the length of the two strings, and then returns the result of concatenating the shorter string, the longer string, and the shorter string once again. You may assume that the strings are of different lengths.

**Note: what to do if both strings have the same length?**
